Ordinarily Crowdin is used for localization, but in this case we are only using the “sentence review” functionality.</p><h3 id="make-sure-the-sentence-meets-the-following-criteria-">Make sure the sentence meets the following criteria:</h3><ol> <li>The sentence must be spelled correctly.</li> <li>The sentence must be grammatically correct.</li> <li>The sentence must be speakable.</li> <li>If the sentence meets the criteria, click the check button on the right.</li> <li>If the sentence does not meet the above criteria, you may correct the sentence there on the website. If you are unsure how to correct the sentence, you may also skip it and move on to the next one.</li> <li>If you run out of sentences to review, please help us collect more sentences!
