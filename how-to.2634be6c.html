There should be no digits in the source text because they can cause problems when read aloud. The way a number is read depends on context and might introduce confusion in the dataset. For example, the number “2409” could be accurately read as both “twenty-four zero nine” and “two thousand four hundred nine”.</li> <li>Abbreviations and Acronyms. Abbreviations and acronyms like “USA” or “ICE” should be avoided in the source text because they may be read in a way that does not coincide with their spelling. Additionally, there may be multiple accurate readings for a single abbreviation. For example, the acronym “ICE” could be pronounced “I-C-E” or as a single word.</li> <li>Punctuation. Special symbols and punctuation should only be included when absolutely necessary. For example, an apostrophe is included in English words like “don’t” and “we’re” and should be included in the source text, but it’s unlikely you’ll ever need a special symbol like “@” or “#.”</li> <li>Foreign letters. Letters must be valid in the language being spoken. For example, “ж” is a letter in the Russian alphabet but is never used in English and so should never appear in any English source text.</li> </ul><h2 id="review-sentences">Review Sentences</h2><h3 id="make-sure-the-sentence-meets-the-following-criteria-">Make sure the sentence meets the following criteria:</h3><ol> <li>The sentence must be spelled correctly.</li> <li>The sentence must be grammatically correct.</li> <li>The sentence must be speakable.</li> <li>If the sentence meets the criteria, click the &quot;yes&quot; button on the right.</li> <li>If the sentence does not meet the above criteria, click the &quot;no&quot; button on the right.
