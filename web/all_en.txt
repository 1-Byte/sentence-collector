It is a magical world filled with elves, dwarves, and dragons.
When will the train arrive this morning?
How often has the train been late?
The ladies and gentlemen I work for would be interested in acquiring your service on a temporary basis.
They would like to meet you to discuss matters in person.
An automobile will arrive at the end of the alley in half an hour, you are to get inside.
Please, call me James.
It has come to our attention that you are a man of adequate talents and little notoriety.
It is my hope that we might develop a fruitful business relationship.
I'm not sure I want any type of relationship with your sort of organisation.
We are not bad people simply because we operate outside of the law.
The law makes who I am illegal, but I have done no harm to anyone. 
We merely wish to employ you to help locate a missing item.
You would be suitably compensated, of course.
A decision not to aid us in an agreeable manner could lead to some seriously disagreeable behaviour on our part.
Very well then, what is it that you need me to track down?
It's a trinket of primarily sentimental value, although it might command a small sum on the open market, belonging to one of my employers.
He misses it greatly and would be very grateful to whomsoever might return it.
Inside, you'll find photographs and a brief synopsis of the item's history.
We would prefer for your search to be carried out discreetly.
I'm sorry, I can't help you.
What assurances do I have that you'll keep my name out of your story?
Why can't this researcher check your facts?
Who sent you to me?
When did you contact her?
It took me most of the day to track you down, it's not like you're listed in the phone book.
I don't have a phone.
Does this mean you're willing to talk to me?
Not just that, I have a feeling I'll be helping you track down your wayward researcher as well.
Perhaps, we could meet at the institute around noon since I have a few things I need to attend to first.
Do you know what he was last working on?
Not specifically no, he only gave me the gist of his research the one time I spoke to him.
Right, well let's poke around his lab a little.
Perhaps, one of his colleagues can shed a little light.
I'm afraid I'll have to see your passes, gentlemen.
Ah, how might one go about getting such a pass?
I issue all passes.
Could you issue us one perchance?
Under what circumstances might you be persuaded to provide us with passes?
You'll need a written letter of invitation from a member of the faculty.
I think we should go.
How did you get in before?
Seems you don't know as much about us as you thought.
I don't suppose you'd be willing to answer some of my questions while we're out here?
Okay kid, ask away.
So why would they want to drop the gold standard if not for the reasons they claim?
I'm a detective, not an economist. 
They go where the money goes. 
I have been directed to assist you with your enquiries.
You have a great deal of experience with investigative work then?
Can you do your babysitting from outside my office?
Noone is likely to hassle me too seriously in a bar full of people, so why don't you wait out here?
Whatever you may think I'm not your dog to be left chained to a lamppost.
Can I get you a drink?
Hey, looks like you made a new friend.
Yeah, one thing cats have going for them is that they don't follow you around so much.
I was hoping you might know a thing or two about my surly shadow?
He's a regular and he's connected, but then I expect you knew that much already.
He's smart, smart enough to keep his intellect hidden and fool people into underestimating him.
You must be mixed up in something pretty big if he's keeping such a close eye on you.
I'm merely being a little more circumspect.
Because prudence was always your strong suit.
You have a couch?
No, I have a single mattress and my office floor.
I assume this was your doing?
Fine, well I need to make a call before we leave.
Be right there, boss!
If you'd please follow me this way.
This is the lab in which the necklace was being stored.
Who was using this lab when the necklace was still here?
Is he not still in the area then?
I'm afraid not, he's visiting a sick relative somewhere in Germany.
So you don't believe it was stolen at all?
I'm sure you'll soon be able to enlighten us all as to the real state of affairs.
Did anyone else share this lab at the time?
I'd still like to have a word with her.
Very well, if you'd like to start your inspection of the lab area I'll go and fetch her.
What's all this about a necklace?
It was how I managed to get us invites to poke around.
I didn't notice a lock on the door.
No, we don't have many locked areas within the facility.
We have a very vigorous screening procedure for new recruits.
Bringing him was a mistake.
Valuable or not, if he becomes a liability, I'll be forced to clean up after you.
Good afternoon sir, how may I be of service?
Please hold while I have someone check our records room.
She'll meet us tonight.
However did you manage that?
When was the last time you spoke with him prior to his departure?
He rarely spoke to me of anything that didn't directly relate to our work.
Hopefully, you'll think twice before giving me the slip in future.
Do you have any suspicions as to who they might be?
I suspect this may be someone new making themselves known.
Might others within your organisation have some inkling as to their desires?
Get up, we're going shopping.
I understand that you're going to want to bring the cops in on this, but I can't be here when you do.
What's your name, and what were you doing here?
And who hired you for this?
Where did you say this man worked?
And what other associates did he have?
No one picked up, so I went by her place on the way here.
She wasn't home, a neighbour said that he didn't think she came in last night.
You mentioned a reporter earlier?
Do you have any idea how long he's likely to be?
Don't worry, I have a feeling I'll be seeing him pretty soon anyway.
She's low down on our list of concerns at the moment.
I'm not sure it'd be too healthy for you to be around me for a while.
So, where are we headed next?
I don't suppose there's some sort of index to all this?
Put that back exactly where you found it this instant.
A pleasure to meet you.
If possible, we'd like the papers a week before and after each of these dates please.
Best not to get in her way when she's on the hunt.
I've got something!
It would appear your employers aren't the stand up guys you'd taken them for.
Whoever the rightful owner is we've still got a whole host of missing scientists to account for.
I'll do my best not to make a mess on the carpet.
I'm afraid this event is by invitation only, sir.
On this particular occasion, you needn't fear.
How did it come to leave your possession then?
And how do you think I can help lure him out?
You weren't kidding about the bait part.
Let me worry about that.
Seems you're hot on the trail now.
Couldn't this have waited until morning?
He was something of a sickly child by all accounts, never made it past his fourth birthday.
That's all you woke me up for, ancient history?
Sorry, I'll explain more when I actually understand what's going on.
It would appear I have an appointment with a ghost.
And which family would that be?
What is it that you want?
What makes you think I'd answer you?
Fine, what makes you think I'd answer you truthfully?
The lies people tell can also be revealing.
Money isn't of interest to me, power is.
Aren't the two rather intertwined?
Not when someone else holds the purse strings.
That was someone else's handy work.
You can go, but remember our deal.
Come after me or one of mine, and that photograph will be everywhere by morning. 
I'm a reporter not a photographer.
Back to our original plan, I think.
It had crossed my mind.
I'll be lucky if she even talks to me again.
Surely when you explain the circumstances of our untimely call she'll understand.
And now she's afraid we've got her all mixed up in mob business.
Well, I have one last play left to try, and this one's a classic.
This was your plan?
It's a move I learnt from you.
Sorry, we didn't even know you were here.
It feels like forever, it's always dark in here.
They don't even bother to ask me questions any more.
Every now and then they remember to give me some food.
I guess I'll have to share my food with you now.
They were waiting for me at home.
You are going to escape.
It was on my to-do list.
Yeah, don't worry we'll find him.
This isn't a doss house.
Just look at the mess you've made of my papers.
I thought I'd near enough collapse as we fled.
I'm not sure how much credit I can take for our escape.
I for one have no doubt that it was your quick wits that saw us delivered from that hellish place.
Either way, I think we should be extremely cautious.
Why are we here?
So, where's the necklace?
I thought I was being clever.
I see now that it was just some perverse form of egotism.
As hiding places go, it isn't the worst.
But we never even got close to it?
No, that was never his real plan.
That's why you collapsed?
How do we know it's really over?
He could still be listening in.
It would certainly fulfil the requirements of my contract.
And you couldn't release him?
We find ourselves in something of a quandary.
You'll not turn this over to your employers then?
What about from an unsafe distance?
You're in no condition to be exerting yourself like that.
In that case, I guess we'll just have to find a way to draw him out.
It would appear to me that the two ideas aren't mutually exclusive.
Might I use your phone?
By all means, it's just down the hallway.
I thought we'd already agreed that we couldn't risk that information falling into his hands.
We already have a perfectly good plan.
We have two perfectly awful plans, and you know it.
So you want to add a third?
It's got the greatest chance of success.
It's also got the greatest chance of you getting locked in a cellar again.
You said it yourself, he doesn't trust easily.
What have I missed?
Trust me, being alone with my thoughts was far more disturbing.
Some company is very welcome right now.
That's what I came to talk to you about.
They both stormed out, neither thinking to fill me in on where they were going.
I'd hoped they'd be back soon, but now I'm really starting to worry.
Do you know what they're up to?
Without knowing where they went, there's not much we can do but wait.
The meeting's set for tomorrow afternoon.
I thought we'd agreed that you wouldn't actually be meeting him?
Negotiations had to be flexible.
And just how do you think we're going to manage that?
It's good to see you up and about.
I'm not sure those were my exact words.
We didn't get the necklace.
If he had it on him then they'll have that, too.
The question of ownership would seem to be a more complicated one.
Might I enquire as to whom I'm addressing?
I assure you, none has a better claim upon that device than myself.
For a start, we both know that I have it.
Would you quit it with that racket!
I'm as much a prisoner as you.
And yet you enjoy a full range of motion.
I hope to finish a month or two before the term starts and travel around Europe a bit.
It takes me about 50 minutes to walk to work.
It's a nice walk though, with trees and a river and stuff.
I've been here over a month.
I don't drink so I wouldn't know.
A guy who'd been living here 3 years was just moving out.
There was a hunger strike going on outside when I was there.
Wasn't there a command line client for ordering pizza somewhere?
We should all go back to living in the trees, much simpler.
No one near the remote machine you could ring?
I get the feeling that's what I probably sound like to Germans.
I'll stick to bad puns in the future, I think.
But I don't think they enforced it much.
I think it takes a while to become active.
I always use dancing hamsters to help me visualise data.
Still not sure why you'd want to do it though.
Okay, there is not a lot to do at the moment.
I tend to avoid speaking to customers much, mostly because of my limited German. 
It's just a quick train ride away.
We're also being given a half day on Monday to go and enjoy it.
I might actually be driving with some coworkers.
I don't think it's as uncommon as you think.
I could be wrong, but it's somewhere in that region.
I doubt they're upgrading without informing people first.
It's a bit of a pain to get everything set up the first time.
I'm not sure what situations they'd be useful for.
I got two nice guitars from there.
Didn't they have any guitars you liked?
When I'm buying a guitar I tend to just fiddle with lots until I find one I really like.
They can give you an idea of how the different guitars compare and what they'll sound like when played properly.
Well, there's a big difference in sound.
Steel can be pretty rough on your fingers when you're just getting to grips with it.
It gives a very nice, deep sound.
They might offer it to you a bit cheaper.
I just worked the tills for a couple of months then got too bored and left.
I feel I should at least get some use out of it.
They sit on lots of patents for stuff.
It's a pretty specialized position.
I like the light tent pictures, too.
I could easily be wrong, so that's just a guess.
We now have about 40 staff members in the main German office.
I think you might quite like to see them.
Beds, beaches, and lawns are good for reading.
He'll appreciate your honesty.
Well, you shouldn't have any trouble then.
I'm no good at keeping an early rising routine.
It's a very good thing to learn about.
I now have a tan that ends abruptly at my knuckles where they were curled over my handlebars.
I sat in on part of a law lecture once.
I'll take a glance if you like.
No idea how it compares in terms of speed.
Doesn't look like that package is still around somewhere.
I'm just writing code to simulate an omnidirectional camera at the moment.
I get to test stuff in the robotics lab.
You can get reasonable at the basics in a few hours.
Making a robot out of ice cream seems very impractical.
The bit between the two car parks?
It's not something I've ever done.
Can't remember where he appears now.
You're not psychotic, you just wish you were?
I tend to just daydream when I'm not doing anything much.
I'll see about doing that tonight then since I've managed to get all my work commitments out of the way.
The robotics group was talking about trying to snag some geography types to do some sort of collaboration.
They're trying to get people with vague ideas for projects to come together.
Okay, that seems fair.
My eyes glaze over just looking at it.
Every time I read through it, I seem to end up rephrasing things and making them shorter.
Right, it shouldn't be too difficult to rework then.
That research group page looked good, by the way.
It's pretty good for single word commands and such though.
It's a nice region.
Not much snow when I was there.
They're not terribly picky.
That's not exactly a widely used piece of software.
I'll be travelling home on Saturday, so probably I won't get anything done then.
It shouldn't be displayed on any book pages, or should it?
Have you tested that and found it not to work?
Perhaps,  you should just grow sea monkeys.
I'm making a robotic guide dog for my dissertation.
I'll forward you the latest email.
Quietness is my normal mode when confronted with lots of random new people.
Actually, quietness is my normal mode in most situations.
Yeah, I had a bit of a poke at that and failed to work out what was wrong.
That's the only chess game I ever played.
I sucked at it, but it was much more fun than most normal chess games.
I did a presentation on silicon chip production and built a proximity sensor for activating garage lights when a car entered.
The library have the unabridged edition, or at least they did a couple of years ago.
I'm definitely out of practice actually writing stuff, too.
I'm liking the sound of this ostrich egg based economy.
I tried so hard to keep myself aloof from your antics.
Shall I meet you in the concourse then?
What time will you be heading across?
I feel like a charlatan using that lift though.
I'd rather just wait a few extra weeks than spend 40 quid.
Take moody black and white photos of people moping in the dark.
We used to just dismantle and hide our sofa in someone's boot.
I found one other vegetarian while I was there.
I'm free pretty much all afternoon.
I'll meet you in the reception area.
Yeah, at least that's the last I heard.
I'm not sure I'd notice the difference.
You could go for a brisk walk up Constitution Hill or something.
Quite a nice view of the town from up there, and it's easy to find.
It's fairly small as hills around here go.
Otherwise you could hide yourself away in some coffee shop or other for a bit.
I want to do more neat robot vision stuff.
Even my research proposal cites about 5 of his papers.
There seems to be some leniency in when the final submission is needed by.
I'm not really sure what's involved in that.
I'm actually planning to try and build a robotics platform around one of those phones.
Do you want to eat first?
Shall I head up now then?
You actually have to do proper work.
What is it you want to research?
I think most people tend to dress pretty casually.
I seem to remember just wearing a t-shirt and jeans.
I go with a random approach to word order in German.
They never did that when I visited.
When I visited everyone had individual interviews.
I think it was pretty soon after getting back from Belgium.
I think I might have gotten a bit bored on that project.
I don't mind having a stab at it this evening if you remind me.
Where can I apply for the job of a millionaire?
Everyone else is smarter than me, and there's only 12 positions across the whole uni.
Well, this is a pretty long shot, but why the heck not? 
Yeah, I'll look in to it.
I thought they navigated based on pheromone trails or something, but apparently not.
I want something that magically transcribes music.
I have no idea what complexity science is.
There's a bunch of school kids in there now.
Do you want to pack before we go out?
I'll meet you in your office then.
I think they're both looking for some sort of new work.
Ready for me to head over?
Just tell me when you're ready.
Complicated is almost always bad.
We can build an army of killer robots.
I hear they do that sort of thing a lot.
It's a nice place to walk around if you decide to go over there. 
Everything authenticates with the main password now.
You guys should try starting small.
I won't be back until next Sunday.
Perhaps, I didn't fill in the right paperwork.
Couple of small bugs, but it gets from one place to another.
There's just one last bug I'd like to fix before I head home.
I was wondering about making an out-takes reel or something.
I haven't had time to get down to the lab and try it since I got it working.
I'm just sitting around watching a video at the moment.
We have an excess of squirrels.
They break in and steal food from the kitchen.
Sheep farming is a competitive world these days.
But do you have a lab full of robots?
I wasn't certain it'd work at all yesterday.
I think you might have mentioned it.
I'm sure they'll be happy to help.
I'm just using the standard report style.
You could type it up manually.
Cowboys used to train badgers to help them herd cattle.
I don't even bother trying to get spiders out of my boat anymore, they're just maintenance-free pets.
Swans try and eat my home sometimes.
My dog barks when strangers arrive.
Every evening, the dogs in our neighbourhood are howling.
Since I've gotten a dog, the regular visits of the fox have stopped.
Our bitch had puppies, do you want one?
Our earth is geologically active, while other planets in the solar system are not.
The funny thing about the horizon is that you can't reach it.
Raleigh scattering is perceived by humans as very beautiful.
Fortunately for us, our sun will continue to be around for a few billion years.
The sun is friendly right now, but it will turn on us and consume this planet.
There are countless possibilities of arranging pieces on a board of chess.
The failed acquisition has sparkled doubts on whether the company's leadership is competent.
For the third quarter in succession, the company didn't manage to leave red numbers.
This company has turned out to be a great success, despite doubts in earlier years.
Sometimes it's smarter to wait, while sometimes you should act.
Last week our fridge broke which forced us to eat lots of ice cream.
This artful creation is more than just a picture, it's a statement by the artist.
The underwater cave is hard to access.
This invention might mean the end of all illness.
On the brink of the fourteenth century, nobody had mobile phones.
The rule is to not let any foreigners in.
The locals had the advantage of knowing the secure path through the marsh.
The future has never been so bright than today.
What have you caused all of this trouble for?
If you dig this tunnel below the building it will collapse, so I urge you to not do it.
It's impolite to ask a tree for its story unless you are ready to hear it in full length.
Eighteen months after the animal has been reported missing it was finally in its owner's arms again.
Many scientists work their entire careers on this, and you say you have solved this in a single afternoon?
Could you give me a piece of bread please?
This is the only building that was left unaffected by fire.
It's a miracle that nobody has found out about this yet.
Why haven't you been to my funeral?
Entering this area is forbidden without stroking the owner's cat first.
The building site was vacated.
The rule has been long and prosperous.
For this entire evening, you have been staring at that waitress!
I have never seen this approach to this issue, but it might work.
This specific approach won't bear any fruit.
The noise came from the basement.
The planet's core is made of solid gold, but every traveller attempting to recover some didn't return.
What did your books tell you about this epoch of the city?
Science has been arguing about the zoological classification of the species for decades.
Our best bet is that this animal is only active at night.
The train is probably the best way to get there.
I don't think this theory explains why the particles attract each other this strongly.
The wine collection is tremendous.
For the best part of its life, the table has been standing in the basement.
I haven't been to this airport in years.
The twenty million dollar project is projected to be finished in eight weeks.
Maybe this is something of great importance.
I'm not familiar with the books this author wrote.
About one in twenty.
I've been very busy the last few weeks.
You can't see the planet with the naked eye.
We have recovered most of the deleted files, but some are still being processed.
The worst outcome is that the company refuses the offer.
In the short term future, prices will triple.
This isn't knitting, its weaving.
The cobalt mine has been abandoned decades ago.
In my wildest dream I hadn't thought that this would happen.
The egg's shell is hard and brittle, while the interior is sticky on the fingers.
Opposite to the main building, you can see the guest house.
Don't believe the lies they are telling you, invent your own instead.
This investment won't pay off.
The boss level is easy.
If a pen has no ink, it's broken.
Moreover, I won't be needed for the next two days.
The damage to the cloth has been repaired quickly.
Immediately after the robbers left the bank, the police were informed.
The first concern is to patch the holes in the ship, then we can pump out the water.
Its easier to endure the cold if you have a warm drink in the belly.
Since it's been repaired, the car hasn't shown the issue any more.
I don't think this wall should be painted the way you suggested.
This carpet is full of lice.
Are you on the guest list?
I welcome you to my humble dwellings.
The garden is older than the house in fact.
Hopefully this will actually be a lasting fix to the issue, and not just a short term fix.
The irregular pattern comes from the pseudorandomness of the function.
The cable doesn't end in the wall plug, but it goes all the way to the power plant.
After the dictator's rule of forty three years was over, the country was devastated.
I have pondered about the issue a bit and arrived at the conclusion that it is non-trivial.
The irrigation system will be fixed within a week.
I'll start my first peach harvest later this year.
I've brought you some cheese, because I know you love cheese.
Thousands of years ago, this town was the center of an ancient civilisation.
Some scientists believe the origin of this oscillating signal to be a neutron star.
The list of shortcomings grows longer and longer.
Amazingly, the wall made of iron didn't feel cold.
The building has been the home base of the illegal enterprise for decades.
The deciding battle of the war has been fought in this valley.
If you add another two storeys, you'll need more support pillars.
For most owners of the car model, the issue isn't noticeable.
The second product of the company turned out to be a great success.
The train came thirteen minutes late.
The issue can be avoided entirely.
This no good alternative.
The shop is open from 8am to 8pm.
The shop is closed on Mondays.
If you tell me why you came here, I'll show you the project I've been working on.
It's too early to tell whether the strategy will pay off.
The story of the city starts a few thousand years ago.
The command was given to erect an outpost to defend strikes from the east.
The little town quickly evolved into a trade center between east and west.
It was located on a shallow river crossing.
The river marked a natural border.
At most places, the river was too deep to cross.
Also, at many places it was hard to leave the water.
Later, a bridge was built.
Anyone passing the bridge had to pay.
In the first few centuries of the town's existence, it was a wooden bridge.
Two hundred years after founding, the town got the right to mint its own coin.
This was thanks to gold being discovered and the building of gold mines.
The city had once been famous for its yearly celebrations.
The celebrations would last a month and include free games and free food.
They were financed through a special celebration tax.
It was raised from everyone who entered the city during the celebration period.
Back in those days, it went really well for the city.
The huge city walls gave the wall epoch its name.
The epoch lasted two hundred years.
The period was enabled by novel stone working techniques.
During the epoch, a majority of the city's buildings were erected.
For example, two of the five bridges in the city today were built back then.
One bridge was only to be used by citizens.
Passing the bridge was free.
The other bridge was for everyone else.
For passing the general bridge, you had to pay.
The first bridge had been funded by rich citizens.
This wasn't just a selfless act, they wanted to become elected.
And they actually were elected into the city council.
This made them even richer.
The second bridge had been funded by public resources to raise taxes.
Today, anyone can pass both bridges for free, but one is closed to cars.
Six hundred years after its founding, the city was at the peak of its building activity.
The city leaders recognized a military threat from the east.
They chose to build strong stone walls around the city.
At the time of their building, the walls were thought to be impenetrable.
Later on, it turned out that the walls were not impenetrable.
For a long time, the city's downfall was attributed to its second sacking.
In fact, this view is still present in many outdated teaching materials.
But recently, the view has been replaced by a more nuanced explanation.
First, the land based trade route between east and west lost relevance.
The north passage became ice-free.
It provided an alternative and cheaper route.
Ship technology has improved.
It was possible to sail the entire route in one go.
Also there was a decrease in trade interest between east and west.
Second, the mines around the city got depleted.
The mines had to be abandoned.
This obviously hurt the economy, as well as city income.
The mines had been ran by the city council.
The two events, less trade and no more gold mines, forced the mint to close.
Third, the empire had shifted its military focus to the west.
Due to this, the city lost a majority of its stationed soldiers.
The city guard had to be reduced as well due to finance shortages.
The loss exposed the city to foreign attackers.
In the end this led to the second sacking of the city.
There was no replacement for armed forces lost in the fight.
There was not enough economic power left to rebuild the city guards.
It didn't help that back then the empire was in the midst of a succession conflict.
So the city was left defenseless for a period of 20 years.
It led to a large exodus of the city, with a majority of the population leaving.
After the empire got a stable government again, the city was reclaimed.
But it was only an image of its former self.
After its demise, the city would never attain its old glory again.
Many of the old buildings still exist today.
Today, people in the city are very thankful for this fact.
Unlike in other cities, most of the buildings weren't destroyed in later times.
This is probably because the buildings were made out of stone.
Stone buildings don't burn.
Another reason is that the city missed out on later economic developments.
So there was no pressure to demolish old buildings to put new ones at their place.
Those buildings and the history around them attract thousands of tourists.
Today, tourism is one of the major economic factors inside the city.
Fortunately its not the sole driving factor of the local economy.
In recent years, the city gained international attention.
The local internet economy is very strong.
It's still young, but who knows where it will lead us.
The final chapter in the city's history has not been opened yet.
The attraction between moon and earth goes both ways, which causes tides.

At the start of the 21st century, we are searching for alternative energy sources.
Oil doesn't make it anymore, it harms the climate.
Same for coal.
I wonder whether we will be able to harvest energy from fusion reactors.
Solar seems like a good replacement.
The solar industry has been on the rise recently.
Prices for solar panels have dropped in past years.
In many areas, there is enough sun so that solar is cheaper than anything else.
Critics say that this is only possible through subsidies.
This view is wrong though.
Other energy sources receive subsidies as well, often much higher.
Also, oil and coal have hidden costs that others have to pay.
That's often due to their nature.
The term for these hidden costs is "Externalities".
One economic mechanism of exposing these costs is internalizing them.
So basically establishing a system where the externalities are added to the price.
This can be done by a tax on oil.
Alternatively, by making oil companies pay for externalities.
Both of these will lead to higher oil prices and make renewables more attractive.
We will tackle this issue, I hope.
In the end it boils down to how much we want it to be solved.
If we actually do want it solved, it will be.

Four doors lead from the landing into two bedrooms, a closet, and a small, but functional bathroom.
The biggest bedroom had a small, ornate fireplace on one wall which had seen recent use judging by the ashes crumbling in the grate.

I have no more to say.
I hope you are well!
I know his voice.

I never thought of that.
I rang the bell.
I shall never forget it.
I shook my head.

Just as I thought!
Just think of it!
Let us sit down.
Long live the king!
May I come in?
May I see it?
May I sit down?

Not a word was said.
Not a word was spoken.
Not if I know it!
Not in the least.
Not on your life!
Not that I know of.
Nothing of the kind.
Nothing to be seen!
Now I must go.
Now what is it?
Now, attend to me.
Of course he did.
Of course I am!
Of course I do!
Of course it is.
Of course we do.
Oh dear, oh dear!
Oh, I beg your pardon!
Oh, I don't know.
Oh, I know it!
Oh, is that all?
Oh, my dear child!
Oh, that will be fun!
Oh, that's too bad!

She could say no more.
She did not answer.
She did not know.
She made no reply.
She rose to her feet.
She shook her head.
She sinks to the ground.
She stared at him.
She was not there.
She was silent for a moment.
So far so good.
So much the better.
Stay where you are.
Take care of yourself.
Tell me about it.
Tell me what it is.
Thank God for that!

That is the question.
That is very interesting.

The other shook her head.

There is a way.
There is no help for it.

There is nothing the matter with me.
There is too much at stake.
There was a long pause.
There was a long silence.
